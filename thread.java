Q1.what is operating system ?
AN operating system act as communication bridge between user and computer hardware . 
 the purpose of os is to provide a platform on which a user can run program convinently and efficiently
 Goals-> to make the computer system convenient to use . 
 there are 7 os--> 1.batch 2.Real time 3. time sharing 4.embeded 5.Distributed 6.network 7.mobile
 OS support multiple software working at the same time and it means it support multitasking.
 MULTITASKING---> multitasking is the ability of the cpu to perform multiple tasks simultaneously. there will be continous context switching 
 of the cpu between the task.
 cpu has a concept of time sharing which means each process runs for short period of time one by one .

 we can also divide our task into small units .
 in the same task or program we can have multiple threads running at the same time 
 Thread is lightweight and it is the smallest unit of the task.
 All threads cannot run at the same time so thread go for the time sharing .
 many processor are allocated with computer resource in respective  time slot .
 scheduler is responsible to allow which thread to execute at what time
